Module "MainMotorDirection" (component BitIO)
   - MainMotorDirection_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - MainMotorDirection_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is 
                read and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - MainMotorDirection_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value 
                to a memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - MainMotorDirection_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - MainMotorDirection_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Selector1" (component PWM)
   - Selector1_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - 
                FFFF value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of 
                predefined values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer 
                possibilities and on the selected period.
   - Selector1_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - Selector1_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.

Module "TU2"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU2_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU2_GetPeriodTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks before re-initialization. See also method <SetPeriodTicks>. This 
                method is available only if the property <"Counter restart"> is switched to 'on-match' value.
   - TU2_GetCounterValue -Returns the content of counter register. This method can be used both if counter is enabled and if 
                counter is disabled. The method is not available if HW doesn't allow reading of the counter.
   - TU2_SetOffsetTicks -Sets the new offset value to channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. It is user responsibility 
                to use value below selected period. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
   - TU2_GetOffsetTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks to compare match channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. 
                See also method <SetOffsetTicks>. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
   - TU2_SelectOutputAction -Sets the type of compare match and counter overflow action on channel output. This method is 
                available when at least one channel is configured.

                predefined values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer 
                possibilities and on the selected period.
   - Selector2_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.

   - TU3_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to

                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

Module "MainMotor" (component PPG)
   - MainMotor_SetPeriodMode -This method switches the component to a specified mode (changes the period/frequency using the 
                mode values). Each mode is identified by a single 8-bit unsigned number which expresses one period/frequency of 
                the generated signal. This method reduce the time needed for setting a new period value. This method is enabled 
                only if a list of possible period settings is specified at design time (see <Timing dialog box> - Runtime 
                setting - from a list of values). Each of these settings constitutes a _/mode/_ and Processor Expert assigns 
                them a _/mode identifier/_ (see public constants in the generated header file). The prescaler and compare 
                values corresponding to each mode are calculated at design time.
   - MainMotor_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 
                Value 0 - 65535 value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer 
                possibilities and on the selected period.  The method is available only if method <SetPeriodMode> is not 
                selected.
   - MainMotor_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number.  The method is available only if method <SetPeriodMode> is not selected.
   - MainMotor_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number.  The method is available only if method <SetPeriodMode> is not selected.
