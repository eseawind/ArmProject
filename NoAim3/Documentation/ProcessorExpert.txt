Module "MainMotorDirection" (component BitIO)
   - MainMotorDirection_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - MainMotorDirection_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is 
                read and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - MainMotorDirection_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value 
                to a memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - MainMotorDirection_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - MainMotorDirection_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
